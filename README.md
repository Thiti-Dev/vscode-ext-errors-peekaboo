## 🎩 About The Project

This is the extension for Visual Studio Code which allows you to peek at the error anytime you want, going back and forth by just the edge of your 3 fingers cmd+shift+[1/2]

`So this extension is created directly for you if you're`

- `Tired of the annoyance of Error Lens that display the stupid error that you already know every time. Sometimes you just wanna chill`
- `Tired of having to use the mouse to hover at the underlined error to be able to see the error`
- `The Problem-Panel (F8) from built-in vscode feature isn't what you really need`
